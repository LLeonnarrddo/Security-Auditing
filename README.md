# Security-Auditing

The paper deals with both the NIST CSF 2.0 and ISO 27001:2022. The end goal is to understand whether these two
frameworks can work together in cybersecurity auditing efforts or if they just are not compatible with each other.
Both NIST CSF 2.0 and ISO 27001:2022 are explained in detail, involving a comparison between their previous 
version and the need for updating them, their main functionalities, and some examples of real-life implementations
of these frameworks.
